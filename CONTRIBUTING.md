# Contributing to MojoDocs

First off, thank you for showing interest in MojoDocs! Even though the core engines are proprietary, we value every bit of feedback and community engagement.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Feature Requests & Ideas
If you have an idea for a new tool that solves a privacy issue, please [open an issue](https://github.com/maisachinsharmahu/mojodocs-public/issues). We are actively building the Q3 roadmap.

### 2. UI/UX Feedback
We want MojoDocs to be the most beautiful tool suite on the web. If you find a layout bug or have a suggestion for better user flow, feel free to open a PR against the `app/` or `components/` folders in this teaser repository.

### 3. Documentation
Found a typo in our massive README? Help us fix it!

## Development Setup

Since this is a teaser repo, you can run the UI locally but the engines will operate in "ghost mode".

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/maisachinsharmahu/mojodocs-public.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the dev server
npm run dev
```

## Security Reporting
If you find a security vulnerability, please do NOT open a public issue. Refer to our [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for private reporting instructions.
